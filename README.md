# VR Archery Game

## Overview

**VR Archery Game** is a virtual reality experience built on the Quest 3 VR headset using Unity. The game immerses players in a realistic archery setting, providing an engaging and skill-based challenge. Players shoot arrows at targets across multiple scenes, each with increasing difficulty.

## Objective

The objective is to create an immersive VR archery game where players score points by hitting targets with arrows. Designed for the Quest 3 VR headset, the game offers a realistic and challenging experience for VR enthusiasts and casual gamers.

## Game Overview

### Game Concept

Set in a training ground environment, players use a virtual bow and arrows to hit targets. The game includes four scenes: start, Level 1, Level 2, and end. Each level introduces new challenges and mechanics to maintain engagement.

### Gameplay Summary

- **Start Scene:** Players begin in a training ground but cannot interact with objects. They can choose to play or quit using ray interaction.
- **Level 1:** Players find a bow and 10 arrows. They must grab the bow with the grip buttons on their controllers and shoot stationary targets. Arrows spawn instantly in the bow and can be shot by pulling the string with the opposite hand. Further targets offer higher points, and targets ignite upon impact.
- **Level 2:** Introduces moving targets and increased difficulty. Targets on the furthest walls are worth more points. Players must use their 10 arrows wisely to score high.
- **End Scene:** Displays the final combined score of both levels and offers options to restart or quit the game.

## Game Mechanics

### Player Controls

- **Grabbing:** Use grip buttons on either controller to grab the bow.
- **Shooting:** Pull the string with the opposite hand to shoot arrows. The shooting distance depends on the strength of the pull.

### Scoring System

Points are awarded based on target distance and difficulty. Further targets yield higher points. Scores from both levels are combined and displayed at the end.

### Arrow Mechanics

Players are limited to 10 arrows per level. Arrows set targets on fire upon impact, providing visual feedback and enhancing immersion.
